Not too long ago we switched from developing new projects out of our local SVN server to private Github repo. 
One of the primary reasons for the switch is that we needed to collaborate better with contractors that did not always have easy access to our network.
But the power of Github and similar hosted solutions is not just in a having a secure, generally available repository, but the extra tooling built on top.

When we decided to take the plunge to Github we opted into a variation of the [Github flow] model.
